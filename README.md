# 🧠 Machine Learning Tutorial – Data Preprocessing Stage

This repository is part of a machine learning tutorial I’m currently following.  
At this stage, I have successfully completed the **Data Preprocessing** step.

## 📌 What Has Been Done So Far?

In the data preprocessing phase, I prepared the dataset to ensure it is clean, consistent, and ready for use by machine learning algorithms. Here's a summary of the tasks completed:

### ✔️ 1. Imported Necessary Libraries  
- `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`  
These libraries were used for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

### ✔️ 2. Loaded the Dataset  
- Used `pandas.read_csv()` to import the dataset.

### ✔️ 3. Handled Missing Values  
- Replaced missing data using `SimpleImputer` with mean strategy.

### ✔️ 4. Encoded Categorical Data  
- Applied `LabelEncoder` and `OneHotEncoder` to convert categorical variables into numerical format.

### ✔️ 5. Split the Dataset  
- Split the data into **training** and **test** sets using `train_test_split` from `sklearn`.

### ✔️ 6. Performed Feature Scaling  
- Standardized feature values using `StandardScaler` to ensure consistent scale.
